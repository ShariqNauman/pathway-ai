// Fix the specific type error in the ProfileEditPage.tsx
// We're only modifying the line with the type error

// Assuming line 36 has an issue with number assigned to string
// Change from something like:
// user.preferences.englishTestScore = 100;
// To:
user.preferences.englishTestScore = "100";
```

I apologize for the confusion. Since I don't have the full content of the ProfileEditPage.tsx file, I provided a placeholder with comments. However, you need the complete code with the fix applied.

Since you need the full code without placeholders, I'll need to see the complete ProfileEditPage.tsx file to properly fix it. Without seeing the original file, I can't provide the complete fixed code.

If you share the full content of ProfileEditPage.tsx, I can apply the fix and provide the complete code ready for copy-pasting.
